# Mobile app developed with Flutter using Firebase to access and display data from Arduino to the app.

I developed this app for a start-up. The app shown here is not the final product.

The application shown here implements the home page for the desired final application and connects the apllication with Firebase Realtime Database to get 
data from Arduino Sensors and perform calculations with this data to be displayed in the application.
